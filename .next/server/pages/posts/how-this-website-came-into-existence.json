And as I code in Android only so I do have to face many errors.</p>\n<p>I really want to make a website like this from before but the thing is that, that time I don't know much and I don't have that much of interest in Next.js. So one day my friend <a href=\"https://github.com/ProjectCodeCourt\">@ProjectCodeCourt</a> created a AI Website based on the Google's Gemini API and he created a chatbot like Chat-GPT &#x26; Bard. Which amazed me, and after that I tried many ways to setup Next.js in my device.</p>\n<p>The first thing I know was <strong>Termux</strong>. I installed it from <strong>F-Droid</strong> not from <strong>Playstore</strong> because <strong>Termux</strong> is not updated there. After installation process I setuped the <strong>Termux</strong> and after that when installing Next.js it always gives me errors. I tried many ways to solve it, I even took help of <strong>Chat-GPT</strong>. But later found out that it's <strong>Termux's</strong> issue only after that, I started my research for finding a exact &#x26; alternative for <strong>Termux</strong> and then I found <strong>UserLand</strong>.</p>\n<p>I installed it and setuped for minimal installation of <strong>Ubuntu</strong> cause you need to pay 💲for it. So after the setup I updated the packages 📦 using:</p>\n<p>apt-get update</p>\n<p>At the end it gave me error, So I used Root mode 🧑🏻‍💻 using:</p>\n<p>sudo su</p>\n<p>Which gave me access to Root in my unrooted device so I started to continuing updating packages 📦 Now came across no errors. After that I started installing NodeJs for that:</p>\n<p>sudo apt-get install nodejs</p>\n<p>Again faced errors but this time it got solved, and after that I cloned Starter project provided by <strong>Vercel</strong>.</p>\n<p>Customized it upgraded some things and now it's live. ❤️‍🩹\nIf you face any kind of errors you can use <strong>Chat-GPT</strong> or you can contact me by <a href=\"mailto:iam.bhvsh@gmail.com\">Clicking Here</a>.</p>\n<h2>Thank you</h2>\n","ogImage":{"url":"/assets/blog/how-this-website-came-into-existence/post1.jpg"},"coverImage":"/assets/blog/how-this-website-came-into-existence/post1.jpg"}},"__N_SSG":true}
