# How this website came into existence ?

## I'm Bhavesh Patil, <br> Frontend Web Developer.

   You can say I'm new in web development, atleast in Next.js. And as I code in Android only so I do have to face many errors.
   
   I really want to make a website like this from before but the thing is that, that time I don't know much and I don't have that much of interest in Next.js. So one day my friend [@ProjectCodeCourt](https://github.com/ProjectCodeCourt) created a AI Website based on the Google's Gemini API and he created a chatbot like Chat-GPT & Bard. Which amazed me, and after that I tried many ways to setup Next.js in my device.
   
   The first thing I know was **Termux**. I installed it from **F-Droid** not from **Playstore** because **Termux** is not updated there. After installation process I setuped the **Termux** and after that when installing Next.js it always gives me errors. I tried many ways to solve it, I even took help of **Chat-GPT**. But later found out that it's **Termux's** issue only after that, I started my research for finding a exact & alternative for **Termux** and then I found **UserLand**.
   
   I installed it and setuped for minimal installation of **Ubuntu** cause you need to pay 💲for it. So after the setup I updated the packages 📦 using:
   
   > apt-get update
   
   At the end it gave me error, So I used Root mode 🧑🏻‍💻 using:
   
   > sudo su
   
   Which gave me access to Root in my unrooted device so I started to continuing updating packages 📦 Now came across no errors. After that I started installing NodeJs for that: 
   
   > sudo apt-get install nodejs
   
  Again faced errors but this time it got solved, and after that I cloned Starter project provided by **Vercel**. 
  
  Customized it upgraded some things and now it's live. ❤️‍🩹
  If you face any kind of errors you can use **Chat-GPT** or you can contact me by [Clicking Here](mailto:iam.bhvsh@gmail.com).
  
## Thank you
